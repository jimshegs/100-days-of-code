# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Preliminaries: Got a template, did some editing so it'll work on CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I thought for a while whether to use a template or start from scratch; decided to use a template as against FreeCodeCamp's recommendation (just to speed things up). I hope I don't regret this.
