# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Started building a Personal Portfolio Webpage. Preliminaries: Got a template, did some editing so it'll work on CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I thought for a while whether to use a template or start from scratch; decided to use a template as against FreeCodeCamp's recommendation (just to speed things up). I hope I don't regret this.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the portfolio page; still trying to make the template work on CodePen. 

**Thoughts:** I hit a few bumps: since I'm using a template, how do I reference the css and js files on Codepen? I got this idea from a friend: I'll push the files online and link to it from CodePen. The day is almost gone. I should get this done by tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 7, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: I was able to make the stylesheets work on Codepen (that gave some trouble). Now the page looks as it should.

**Thoughts:** I didn't log yesterday although I coded. That was because I didn't make any headway with the portfolio page; the page wasn't just styling. The contents of the stylesheets were seen as plain text but thanks to stack overflow, I was able to figure it out and make it work properly
