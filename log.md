# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Started building a Personal Portfolio Webpage. Preliminaries: Got a template, did some editing so it'll work on CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I thought for a while whether to use a template or start from scratch; decided to use a template as against FreeCodeCamp's recommendation (just to speed things up). I hope I don't regret this.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the portfolio page; still trying to make the template work on CodePen. 

**Thoughts:** I hit a few bumps: since I'm using a template, how do I reference the css and js files on Codepen? I got this idea from a friend: I'll push the files online and link to it from CodePen. The day is almost gone. I should get this done by tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 7, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: I was able to make the stylesheets work on Codepen (that gave some trouble). Now the page looks as it should.

**Thoughts:** I didn't log yesterday although I coded. That was because I didn't make any headway with the portfolio page; the page wasn't just styling. The contents of the stylesheets were seen as plain text but thanks to stack overflow, I was able to figure it out and make it work properly

### Day 4: January 8, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: JavaScript: I used gulp to combine the scripts that came with the template into one so I can reference it from Codepen. Now my page's JS works!

**Thoughts:** I was feeling a little bit down today and I considered not logging but thanks to [Teejay.Codes](http://teejay.codes/) who gave me a little nudge. Good friends are paramount in achieving one's goals.

### Day 5: January 10, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on the content of my portfolio page (Still on it though).

**Thoughts:** This is taking more time than I thought.

### Day 6: January 11, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the content of my portfolio page; did a bit of restructuring and included buttons to my social media pages. The page is gradually taking shape.

**Thoughts:** There are still a few things left to work on: 
              - thumbnail images of projects I've worked on
              - the Contact section (how do I make it send me a mail?)
              
              Electricity is a big problem in Africa. I do less than I should because of unstable power supply. Also, it'll help to have a better laptop, one with battery that lasts longer.

### Day 7-8: January 12-13, 2017 


**Progress**:  I added thumbnail images of my past projects. Now, I have fulfilled all the user stories required by [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) for the portfolio page. 

**Thoughts:** I spent quite some time trying to figure out how to use modals to display my past projects to no avail. It's either that I can't do that on Codepen or I just haven't figured it out yet.
